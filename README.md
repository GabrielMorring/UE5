# Overview

I made a simple first person shooter game. It is just a small map with a lot of targets in it. And the goal of the game is to see how many targets you can hit before a timer runs out.

I just made this to learn how to use unreal engine, because I think it is a really cool piece of software.

# Development Environment

I used Unreal Engine 5 for this. I did not use any programming languages directly, but unreal engine uses c++.

# Future Work

* I would like to add a system to save how many targets you hit each round so you can keep score.
